everytime i think of it i feel someone- something behind me. it has happened so long ago but i just cant forget about it.so i was at kindergarden(as always) and it had ended 
10 minutes ago but i was waiting for my parents to come pick me up. once they were here, i headed back to the classroom with a teacher i had never seen since that day onwards. 
once i enered the room, i grabed my back and turned around, only to see that the horse toy that was once facing the door turn slowly towards me. the teacher(or so i thought) then
whispered"theres no escape now,, im coming for you" i turned back again, but the teacher was nowhere to be seen. frightened, i ran put to my parent's car and did not speak of
that to anyone, fearing that something would happen to me.well, technically i was wrong, it still came for me.i was 17 that year, i was in my school dorms assigned to me, 
noone but my usually quiet roomate was there. she had this creepy glint in her eyes that were slightly familiar, but i just brushed it of as i thought i was just overthinking.
so as usual(again:/)i went to sleep. I did not know why, but this time was different. i had woken up to a strange sound of scratching of wood, so i turned to look at my 
alarm clock as i thought i was dreaming, then slapped myself to see if i was really hallucinating. i woke up, literally not knowing why at 12 oclock , midnight sharp. sighing, i said 
to myself "ugh im dreaming, ill just go back to sleep. then it happened. "wAkE Up, iTs TiMe! I hAvE BeEn wAitINg FoR YoU, cRaViNg fOr THiS MoMeNt.nOw wAkEy wAkEy i SeE YoU.!
i looked at the clock, 3 oclock sharp. i tried to scream but it was too late.the face covered in blood, yet with a cartoon-like smile, with crooked yellow teeth,standing right above
me."wELl HeLlO ChlOe, iT HaS BeEn A lONG tImE SInCe i SaW YoU, gOoD NiGhT, SLeEp TigHt'
